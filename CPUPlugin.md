| **Node** | **Node** | **Node** | **Value** | **Metric** | **Retrieval Method** |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:-----------|:---------------------|
| CPU|  |  |  |  |  |
|  | Manufacturer |  | _string_ |  | If the architecture is ARM parse the `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the manufacturer code in line starting with _CPU implementer_ (see below) |
|  | Instruction Set |  | _string_ |  | `System.getProperty(OS_ARCH)` |
|  | Name |  | _string_ |  | Parse the `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the processor name code in line starting with _Processor_ |
|  | Operational Frequency |  | _double_ | MHz | Read the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/cpuinfo_max_freq` file and divide by 1000 to get MHz |
|  | Cores |  | _int_ |  | Parse `/proc/cpuinfo` file. Number of cores is detected by the count _Processor_ line that occur in the file |
|  | CPU Revision |  | _int_ |  | Parse `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the line _CPU revision_. |
|  | CPU Variant |  | _int_ |  | Parse `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the line _CPU variant_. |
|  | Features |  | _string_ |  | Parse `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the line _Features_. Value represents list of CPU's features. |
|  | Hardware |  | _string_ |  | Parse `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the line _Hardware_. Represents the manufacturing technology of the CPU |
|  | Revision |  | _string_ |  | Parse `/proc/cpuinfo` file for the line _Revision_. |
